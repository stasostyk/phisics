        <h1>Why keep phisics up and running?</h1>
        <p>Even after two years since launching, phisics.tech maintains an active user base of students from around the world learning physics. With nearly <strong>30,000 users</strong> since its launch, every day has more users coming in to learn something new.</p>
        <p>In 2023, a consistent <strong>400 students</strong> use the website every month with an average viewtime of around a minute and a half. Seeing 10 new connections from Nairobi appear as a teacher just told their students to open a phisics simulation inspires me to keep the site up and running.</p>

        <h1>Why should I support?</h1>
        <p>For complete transparency, I pay 40 euros per year to keep the website up, along with several hours of maintenance. Supporting me with just <strong>2 euros</strong> will help me keep this up every year so that everyone has access to interactive simulations around the world. <strong>Thank you so much for your support!</strong></p>
