[Phisics.tech](https://phisics.tech) is a website with the aim of teaching physics through simulations. Physics is often hard to conceptualize with just long... laws... and f0rmu1a5. The best way to experience phyiscs is to visualize it. This project intends on showing those real life phenomena in an interactive, controlled, and understandable environment. Have fun!

## <p align="center">Currently being used by 27,000+ students from 132 countries!</p>

## How to contribute

I am open to any helpful contribution! If you want to add a simulation or edit one, I recommend using the p5js online editor at [editor.p5js.org](https://editor.p5js.org/). Note: If you only want to contribute a p5js simulation, go for it and I will include it in the actual website!

## Comments, advise, corrections, or partnerships?
I would love to hear from you by email at <a href="mailto:s.ostyks@gmail.com">s.ostyks@gmail.com</a>. You can reach out in English, Polish, or Spanish.

## Hosting the website locally

1. Download the [ruby programming language](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)

2. In your terminal, download [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) by running the following code
```
~ $ gem install bundler jekyll
```

3. In your terminal, navigate to the root directory of this project (download it first!) and run
```
~/phisics $ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

4. In your browser, open `localhost:4000` or `127.0.0.1:4000`
